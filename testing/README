1. ./runalltests.py will test all unit tests.
2. stub_server/file_service.py is used as the stub server during the tests.
3. If you are running testAPIClient or runalltests, please run "sudo bash"  and "exit"
   to allow bash session to get the temporary root previlege. This is because testAPIClient
   uses "iptables" to enable/disable network during the tests. For details, refer to file
   "testAPIClient".
